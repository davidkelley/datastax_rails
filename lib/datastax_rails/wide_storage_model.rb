module DatastaxRails
  # A special model that is designed to efficiently store very wide data.
  # This model type assumes that you have a unique ID and want to either
  # search or sort on a second piece of data.  The store the data as a
  # single, very wide row; however you can safely treat them as if
  # there were multiple rows.
  #
  # CAVEATS: 
  # * Wide Storage Models cannot be indexed into Solr.
  # * Once the cluster is set, it cannot be changed as it becomes the column header in Cassandra
